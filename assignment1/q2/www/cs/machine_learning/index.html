    <h1>Ava Lovelace</h1>
    <p>The proffesor in charge of cunducting the Machine Learning class at Web Design University is Ada Lovelace. Ada is an English mathematician an writer known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer. Ada was the first to recognize that these machines had applications beyond basic calculation. She was the first to publish an algorithm designed to be computed by these machines. Ada Lovelace was also one of the first computer programmers and is held i n the highest regard in the feild of computer science. We are so very pleased she is leading our Machine Learning lectures at Web Design University and we have such high hopes for the class.</p>
